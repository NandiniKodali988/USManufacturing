# a written report describing
What the goal of the project is, and whether the goal has changed since the proposal due to availability of data, the inferences that can be drawn from the available data, or other qualitative or technical reasons

An update on the tangible progress that has been made. At this stage you should have:

- your narrative sketched out with a clear story and conclusions, including the format of narrative storytelling you plan to use
- an understanding of what visualizations you will use to support your narrative (that also meet the requirements of the project)
- a technical understanding of how you will transform your data into the visualizationso that you will include to support your narrative
- most of your visualizations done in rough form, i.e. the visualizations arenâ€™t polished or well-annotated yet, but we see the visual encodings and the story that each visualization is telling to advance the narrative (earning its place in the narrative)

## Trade

- This project explores how the U.S. manufacturing industry has evolved in global trade from 2009 to 2024 by analyzing product-level import and export data. It investigates which product sectors have grown in export strength, which have become more dependent on imports, and how the overall trade balance has shifted over time.
- Visualization 1: Animated Bubble Chart. Visualization 2: All Merchandise Bubble Animation. 3. Visualization 3: Static Trade Balance Line Plot
- Technical Data Transformation Approach: Data Source-Data Cleaning-Data Merging-Ranking- Bubble Size-Plotting
- Results: the U.S. imports far more than it exports (a negative balance): 1.Domestic manufacturing may be weakened 2.Production is offshored or non-competitive 3.Could indicate decline or stagnation.
