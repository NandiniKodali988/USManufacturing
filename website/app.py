# Introduction
Welcome to our interactive data dashboard. In this app, we take a deep dive into the **past, present, and future of U.S. manufacturing**, drawing from national statistics and industry-specific data.

**Why this matters:**  
Manufacturing plays a critical role in employment, exports, innovation, and economic stability. But its form is evolving.

This app is divided into two parts:

- 🔍 **Big Picture** — Understand how manufacturing contributes to GDP, employment. 
- 🧩 **Small Picture** — Dive into Buyers and Producers

# 🌍 Global Manufacturing Share of GDP (2013–2024)

- Displays manufacturing output as % of GDP across countries
- Darker blue indicates higher manufacturing contribution
- Key observations:
  - **Asia** (China, Vietnam) leads in manufacturing share
  - **U.S. manufacturing share** remains comparatively lower
  - **Emerging economies** show steady industrial growth
- Reveals shifting patterns in global industrial competitiveness

# Employment Rate 
- The **U.S. has experienced a long-term decline in manufacturing’s share of GDP**, contrasting with Asia-Pacific industrial giants.
- **Employment has decreased**, but this does not necessarily reflect a failing sector—it reflects increasing automation, outsourcing, and a shift toward high-value manufacturing.
- A new form of industrial economy is emerging—one that may not be labor-intensive but still strategically essential.

This raises a natural next question:  
**How are specific manufacturing subsectors performing—and who is driving this transformation?**

# 📊 Annual Worker Metrics Parallel Coordinates

This plot visualizes the annual trends of several key labor metrics from **2013 to 2024**.

Each line represents a different year, tracking across four dimensions:
- **Hourly Earnings**
- **Total Compensation per Hour**
- **Wage Cost per Hour**
- **Weekly Hours**

The color gradient from light blue to dark blue represents the timeline:  
lighter colors are earlier years, darker colors are more recent years.

## 🔍 Why This Plot Matters

- **Compare multiple metrics simultaneously**, showing relationships across time.
- **Overall wage increase** observed after 2020.
- **Significant dip around 2020**, likely caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Highlights evolving **labor cost and productivity** trends across a decade.

# --- Producer ---
st.markdown("""
# Producer
To better understand the transformation, we now shift from the **macro scale** into **Buyers and Producers** perspective.

Our parallel coordinates plot reveals:
- **Steady increases in hourly earnings and total compensation** over the past decade
- **Relatively flat or slightly declining weekly hours**, suggesting efficiency gains

These labor dynamics reflect **rising costs per hour** but not necessarily falling competitiveness.

In addition, the connected scatterplot links **labor productivity** with **unit labor costs**, across policy shifts (A, B, C). We observe how policy environments correspond with changes in both efficiency and cost burdens, highlighting the **trade-offs of regulatory and economic decisions**.

Lastly, we examine **GDP contribution growth rates** across subsectors to see where the momentum lies—and which industries are driving the modern manufacturing engine.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways (Small Picture)
- **Worker compensation is rising**, but not at the expense of weekly hours—pointing to increased wage pressure and potential productivity trade-offs.
- **Policy shifts are tightly linked** to changes in cost-productivity dynamics, and visualizing them helps contextualize what drives these transitions.
- Certain manufacturing subsectors are **outpacing others in GDP growth**, suggesting that the decline narrative is not universal—**some producers are thriving**.

This producer-centered perspective helps us understand not just the “what” of the trend, but the **“who” and “why”** behind the change.
